# NoStump
A simple mod that destroys a stump whenever you cut down a tree.

## Installation
Requires [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) to work.

## Configuration
By default you would still get the loot from the destroyed stump. To disable it, set **EnableDrop** to false.
