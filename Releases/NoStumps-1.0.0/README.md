# NoStump
A simple mod that destroys a stump whenever you cut down a tree.

## Installation
This is a **client-side** only mod.
Requires [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) to work. Put the .dll file into `\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx\plugins` folder, config file will be generated automatically.

## Configuration
By default you would still get the loot from the destroyed stump. To disable it, set `EnableDrop` to `false`.
